# Semgrep suppressions for benchmark harness
# Each suppression must have a documented justification

# GUI innerHTML usage (javascript-innerhtml-xss)
# Justification: The GUI code uses innerHTML with template literals to render dynamic content
# from trusted sources (server API responses). The data is controlled server-side and the GUI
# is a single-page application with no user-generated content injection vectors.
# Files: gui/components.js, gui/main.js, gui/qa/main.js, gui/run.js
# Risk: Low - data source is trusted, no external user input in templates

# GUI location redirect (javascript-open-redirect)
# Justification: The redirect in gui/run.js:342 uses encodeURIComponent on a run_id
# returned from the server and redirects to a local /ui/ path (not external).
# File: gui/run.js:342
# Risk: Low - redirect target is local path with encoded parameter
