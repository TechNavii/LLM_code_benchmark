# Hardcoded Values Allowlist
# ==========================
# This file contains justified suppressions for the hardcoded values scanner.
#
# Format: file_path:regex_pattern # justification
#
# Guidelines:
# - Each suppression MUST have a justification explaining why it's safe
# - Prefer fixing the code over adding suppressions
# - Review this file periodically to remove stale entries
# - Never suppress actual secrets - instead, move them to environment variables
#
# Examples:
# docs/example.md:api_key.*example  # Documentation example, not a real key
# tests/fixtures/config.py:/home/testuser  # Test fixture path, not real

# Currently no suppressions are needed - the scanner excludes:
# - Test files using /tmp paths (safe for tests)
# - .env.example (expected to have placeholder formats)
# - Redaction code and tests (patterns, not secrets)
# - URLs (https://* are not filesystem paths)
# - Localhost/loopback IPs (safe defaults)
# - Lock files (hashes, not secrets)
