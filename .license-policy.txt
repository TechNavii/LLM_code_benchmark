# License Policy - Package Allowlist
#
# This file contains packages with non-standard licenses that have been
# reviewed and approved for use in this project.
#
# Format: package-name
# Each entry should have a comment explaining why the exception is allowed.
#
# Add packages here when:
# 1. The license is compatible with project use but not in the standard allowlist
# 2. The package is only used for development/testing (not distributed)
# 3. A special exception has been granted with legal review
#
# Examples:
# some-gpl-dev-tool  # Only used in dev, not distributed
# legacy-package     # Reviewed on 2024-01-01, compatible with our use case

# No exceptions currently required - all dependencies use approved licenses
