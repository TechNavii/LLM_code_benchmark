foundation-001-validator-entrypoints: Created standardized validator scripts (lint.sh, typecheck.sh, test.sh) with virtualenv management, requirements-dev.txt, and brownfield-safe tool configurations (ruff, mypy) in pyproject.toml. All validators pass.
quality-001-formatting: Added ruff format configuration to pyproject.toml, integrated format check into lint.sh, created format.sh for developer auto-fix, and formatted 15 files. All validators pass.
quality-002-lint-static-analysis: Verified ruff linting configuration with E (pycodestyle) and F (pyflakes) rules, scoped to lintScope with targeted per-file ignores. Integrated into lint.sh. All validators pass.
quality-003-typecheck: Verified mypy type checking with brownfield-safe configuration in pyproject.toml, scoped to server/, harness/, tests/, and conftest.py. Fast and deterministic execution integrated into typecheck.sh. All validators pass.
tests-001-unit-test-harness: Added characterization tests for /health endpoint, root redirect, UI mount, and CORS middleware in test_api_endpoints.py. Verified existing tests for config parsing, validators, and progress managers. All tests hermetic and integrated into test.sh. 31 tests pass.
tests-002-critical-path-regression-suite: Created test_critical_paths.py with black-box smoke tests for server health, runs listing, leaderboard, task discovery, models capabilities, and OpenAPI schema. Suite runs in <2 seconds. 43 tests pass.
tests-003-integration-tests: Created test_integration.py with integration tests for database init/queries, filesystem persistence, and WebSocket streams via ProgressManager. Tests use real SQLite DB, tempdir for filesystem isolation, and asyncio for stream validation. All hermetic and fast. 48 tests pass.
tests-004-e2e-smoke: E2E smoke tests already implemented in test_api_endpoints.py. Tests exercise create_app(), verify /ui mount, /health endpoint, root redirect, and CORS middleware. Happy path focused, hermetic, and reproducible. All validators pass.
quality-004-coverage-reporting: Enabled pytest-cov with coverage tracking for server/ and harness/. Set baseline threshold to 24% (current coverage 24.35%). Added term-missing and HTML reports (htmlcov/). Coverage prevents regression and will be published in CI. All validators pass.
ci-001-quality-gates: Created GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml) that runs lint, typecheck, and test validators on push and PR. Uses Python 3.11, caches pip and virtualenv for speed, fails on validator failures, uploads coverage to Codecov and artifacts. All validators pass.
security-001-dependency-vulnerability-scan: Added pip-audit scanning via scripts/security-scan.sh for all requirements files. Created .pip-audit-suppressions.txt with documented justifications for 3 transitive dependency CVEs. Added docs/SECURITY.md with remediation workflow. Integrated into CI workflow. All validators pass.
security-002-secret-scanning: Integrated Gitleaks for secret scanning via GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/secret-scanning.yml). Created .gitleaks.toml with allowlist configuration. Updated docs/SECURITY.md with secret rotation process and best practices. Scans run on push and PR. Gitleaks does not log sensitive values. All validators pass.
