foundation-001-validator-entrypoints: Created standardized validator scripts (lint.sh, typecheck.sh, test.sh) with virtualenv management, requirements-dev.txt, and brownfield-safe tool configurations (ruff, mypy) in pyproject.toml. All validators pass.
quality-001-formatting: Added ruff format configuration to pyproject.toml, integrated format check into lint.sh, created format.sh for developer auto-fix, and formatted 15 files. All validators pass.
quality-002-lint-static-analysis: Verified ruff linting configuration with E (pycodestyle) and F (pyflakes) rules, scoped to lintScope with targeted per-file ignores. Integrated into lint.sh. All validators pass.
quality-003-typecheck: Verified mypy type checking with brownfield-safe configuration in pyproject.toml, scoped to server/, harness/, tests/, and conftest.py. Fast and deterministic execution integrated into typecheck.sh. All validators pass.
tests-001-unit-test-harness: Added characterization tests for /health endpoint, root redirect, UI mount, and CORS middleware in test_api_endpoints.py. Verified existing tests for config parsing, validators, and progress managers. All tests hermetic and integrated into test.sh. 31 tests pass.
