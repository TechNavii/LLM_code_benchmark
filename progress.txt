foundation-001-validator-entrypoints: Created standardized validator scripts (lint.sh, typecheck.sh, test.sh) with virtualenv management, requirements-dev.txt, and brownfield-safe tool configurations (ruff, mypy) in pyproject.toml. All validators pass.
quality-001-formatting: Added ruff format configuration to pyproject.toml, integrated format check into lint.sh, created format.sh for developer auto-fix, and formatted 15 files. All validators pass.
quality-002-lint-static-analysis: Verified ruff linting configuration with E (pycodestyle) and F (pyflakes) rules, scoped to lintScope with targeted per-file ignores. Integrated into lint.sh. All validators pass.
quality-003-typecheck: Verified mypy type checking with brownfield-safe configuration in pyproject.toml, scoped to server/, harness/, tests/, and conftest.py. Fast and deterministic execution integrated into typecheck.sh. All validators pass.
tests-001-unit-test-harness: Added characterization tests for /health endpoint, root redirect, UI mount, and CORS middleware in test_api_endpoints.py. Verified existing tests for config parsing, validators, and progress managers. All tests hermetic and integrated into test.sh. 31 tests pass.
tests-002-critical-path-regression-suite: Created test_critical_paths.py with black-box smoke tests for server health, runs listing, leaderboard, task discovery, models capabilities, and OpenAPI schema. Suite runs in <2 seconds. 43 tests pass.
tests-003-integration-tests: Created test_integration.py with integration tests for database init/queries, filesystem persistence, and WebSocket streams via ProgressManager. Tests use real SQLite DB, tempdir for filesystem isolation, and asyncio for stream validation. All hermetic and fast. 48 tests pass.
tests-004-e2e-smoke: E2E smoke tests already implemented in test_api_endpoints.py. Tests exercise create_app(), verify /ui mount, /health endpoint, root redirect, and CORS middleware. Happy path focused, hermetic, and reproducible. All validators pass.
