# Artifact Hygiene Allowlist
# ==========================
# This file lists files that are intentionally tracked despite being in
# artifact directories or matching artifact patterns.
#
# Format: file_path # justification
#
# Guidelines:
# - Each entry MUST have a justification explaining why it's tracked
# - Prefer excluding files from tracking over adding allowlist entries
# - Review this file periodically to remove stale entries
#
# Currently no files are allowlisted.
