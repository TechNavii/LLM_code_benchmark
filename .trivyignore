# Trivy Ignore File
# See https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/configuration/filtering/
#
# This file contains suppressions for known/acceptable findings.
# Each suppression MUST include explicit justification.
#
# Format:
#   # Justification: <reason why this is acceptable>
#   <CVE-ID or vulnerability identifier>
#
# Categories of acceptable suppressions:
# 1. False positives (vulnerability does not apply to our usage)
# 2. Disputed vulnerabilities (contested by vendor/community)
# 3. No fix available AND risk is mitigated by other controls
# 4. Test/development dependencies only (not in production)
#
# DO NOT suppress without justification. All suppressions are reviewed.

# Known False Positives
# =============================================================================

# No specific suppressions yet - add as needed with justification

# Example format:
# # Justification: CVE-XXXX-XXXX affects feature X which we don't use.
# # Our code only uses feature Y which is not affected.
# # Tracking issue: https://github.com/org/repo/issues/XXX
# CVE-XXXX-XXXX

# =============================================================================
# Development-Only Dependencies
# =============================================================================

# No specific suppressions yet - add as needed with justification

# Example format:
# # Justification: CVE-XXXX-XXXX affects package-name which is only used
# # for development/testing. Not deployed in production environments.
# # The vulnerability requires network access which is blocked in CI.
# CVE-XXXX-XXXX

# =============================================================================
# Disputed/Contested Vulnerabilities
# =============================================================================

# No specific suppressions yet - add as needed with justification

# Example format:
# # Justification: CVE-XXXX-XXXX is disputed by the maintainer.
# # See: https://github.com/package/repo/issues/XXX
# # Risk is minimal as the attack vector requires admin access.
# CVE-XXXX-XXXX

# =============================================================================
# Waiting for Upstream Fix
# =============================================================================

# No specific suppressions yet - add as needed with justification

# Example format:
# # Justification: CVE-XXXX-XXXX has no fix available yet.
# # Tracking upstream: https://github.com/package/repo/issues/XXX
# # Mitigated by: input validation in server/routes/router.py
# # Review date: 2025-02-01
# CVE-XXXX-XXXX
